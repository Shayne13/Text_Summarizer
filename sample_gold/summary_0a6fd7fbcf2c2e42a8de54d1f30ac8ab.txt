Lundomys molitor, also known as Lund's Amphibious Rat or the Greater Marsh Rat, is a semiaquatic rat species from southeastern South America.
Its distribution is now restricted to Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but it previously ranged northward into Minas Gerais, Brazil, and southward into eastern Argentina.
The Argentinean form may have been distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay.
L.�molitor is a large rodent, with the head and body length averaging 193�mm (7.60�in), characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur.
It builds nests above the water, supported by reeds, and it is not currently threatened.
Its external morphology is similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis and over the course of its complex taxonomic history, it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys.
Within the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.
